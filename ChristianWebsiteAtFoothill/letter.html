            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>To the incoming class: Welcome! Both to Foothill students, and to what will surely be some of the most
                memorable years of your life. For many of us, our college years have afforded us a new beginning in our
                Christian lives, and as a club we pray that you, too, would be afforded the same opportunity to begin
                anew with God. Foothill Christian Students welcomes all students, regardless of denominational
                background, who want to grow in their relationship with the Lord during their college years.

            <p>The Christian life is not an easy one, especially by yourself, so we hope to provide a place where you
                can be connected with other believers and be encouraged to run this Christian race together. Here are a
                couple of testimonies from our own upperclassmen:</p></br>
            <p>"I admit I wasn’t the strongest Christian coming into college. Although my parents would take me to
                church, I only ever went through the motions — my heart wasn't really dedicated to the Lord back then.
                Coming into Stanford as a freshman, I didn’t really know anyone, and I felt lost, oblivious, and
                homesick. However, the people from Stanford Christian Students were the first to approach me and welcome
                me. As I attended their meetings and met with the other members, the club taught me what it means to
                truly open up and spend time with the Lord. Whether it was through singing, praying, reading the Bible,
                or just catching up, I really started loving every part of my fellowship with the students and staff.
                Honestly, I'm so blessed for the club, because with them, my Christian journey has been renewed and
                stronger than ever. Stanford Christian Students is where I met my first friends in college and where I
                found my home back in the Lord Jesus."

                "I was blessed to have a Christian household growing up, so I’ve known of the Lord for a long time, but
                I don’t think that I’ve truly come to know Him better until recently. I had a lovely home church, and
                I’ve been saved for pretty much as long as I remember. However, I feel like one of my most powerful
                tests of faith was moving to college. I had never been the type of person to ask for help willingly or
                often; I took pride in being able to overcome most challenges “on my own.” When I started at Stanford,
                though, with my previous support structures many miles away, I realized that my attitude wasn’t
                completely sustainable, and that God still needed to be just as big a part of my life as before. I’m so
                happy that I found Stanford Christian Students during my freshman fall. The entire group—students and
                staff alike—have been so welcoming to me and helpful during my journey as young Christian finally having
                to seek the Lord herself!"
